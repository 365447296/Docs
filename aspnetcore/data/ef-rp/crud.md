# Create, Read, Update, and Delete - EF Core with Razor Pages tutorial (2 of 10)

By [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra) and [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

In the [previous tutorial](xref:data/ef-rp/intro), a Razor Pages web app was created that stores and displays data using EF and SQL Server LocalDB. In this tutorial, the scaffolded CRUD (create, read, update, delete) code is reviewed and customized.

Note: It's a common practice to implement the repository pattern in order to create an abstraction layer between the UI (Razor Pages) and the data access layer. To keep these tutorials simple and focused on teaching EF, the repository pattern is not used. For information about repositories with EF, see [the last tutorial in this series](xref:data/ef-mvc/advanced).

In this tutorial, you work with the Create, Edit, Delete, and Details Razor Pages in the *Student* folder.

## Customize the Details page

Browse to `Pages/Students` page. The **Edit**, **Details**, and **Delete** links are generated by the [Anchor Tag Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/anchor-tag-helper) 
in the *Pages/Students/Index.cshtml* file.

<!--2do ricka. if Index doesn't change, remove dup -->
[!code-cshtml[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Index1.cshtml?range=40-44)]

Select a Details link. The URL is of the form `http://localhost:1234/Students/Details?id=2`. The Student ID is passed using a query string (`?id=2`). 

Update the Edit, Details, and Delete Razor Pages to use the `"{id:int}"` route template. Change the page directive for each of these pages from `@page` to `@page "{id:int}"`. 

A request to the page with the "{id:int}" route template that does **not** include the integer returns an HTTP 404 (not found) error. For example, `http://localhost:1234/Students/Details` returns a 404 error. To make the ID optional, append `?` to the route constraint:

 ```cshtml
@page "{id:int?}"
```
Run the app, click on a Details link, and verify the URL is passing the ID as route data (`http://localhost:1234/Students/Details/2`).

Don't globally change `@page` to `@page "{id:int}", doing so breaks the links to the Home and Create pages.

### Add related data

The scaffolded code for the Students Index page left out the `Enrollments` property, because that property holds a collection. In this section, the contents of the `Enrollments` collection is displayed in the Details page.

The `OnGetAsync` method of *Pages/Students/Details.cshtml.cs* uses the `SingleOrDefaultAsync` method to retrieve a single `Student` entity. Add the following highlighted code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Details.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_Details&highlight=8-12)]

The `Include` and `ThenInclude` methods cause the context to load the `Student.Enrollments` navigation property, and within each enrollment the `Enrollment.Course` navigation property.  You learn more about these methods in the reading-related data tutorial.

The `AsNoTracking` method improves performance in scenarios when the entities returned are not updated in the current context. `AsNoTracking` is discussed later in this tutorial.

### Display related enrollments on the Details page

Open *Pages/Students/Details.cshtml*.  Add the following highlighted code to display a list of enrollments:

 <!--2do ricka. if doesn't change, remove dup -->
[!code-cshtml[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Details1.cshtml?highlight=35-53)]

If code indentation is wrong after you paste the code, press CTRL-K-D to correct it.

The preceding code loops through the entities in the `Enrollments` navigation property. For each enrollment, it displays the course title and the grade. The course title is retrieved from the Course entity that's stored in the `Course` navigation property of the Enrollments entity.

Run the app, select the **Students** tab, and click the **Details** link for a student. You see the list of courses and grades for the selected student.

## Update the Create page

Update the `OnPostAsync` method in *Pages/Students/Create.cshtml.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Create.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostAsync)]

<a name="TryUpdateModelAsync"></a>
### TryUpdateModelAsync

Examine the [TryUpdateModelAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controllerbase.tryupdatemodelasync?view=aspnetcore-2.0#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_ControllerBase_TryUpdateModelAsync_System_Object_System_Type_System_String_) code:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Create.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_TryUpdateModelAsync)]

In the preceding code, `TryUpdateModelAsync<Student>` tries to update the `emptyStudent` object using the posted form values from the [PageContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razorpages.pagemodel.pagecontext?view=aspnetcore-2.0#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_RazorPages_PageModel_PageContext) property in the [PageModel](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.razorpages.pagemodel?view=aspnetcore-2.0). `TryUpdateModelAsync` only updates the properties listed (`s => s.FirstMidName, s => s.LastName, s => s.EnrollmentDate`).

In the preceding sample:

* The second argument (` "student",   // Prefix`) is the prefix uses to look up values. It's not case sensitive.
* The posted form values are converted to the types in the `Student` model using [model binding](xref:mvc/models/model-binding#how-model-binding-works).

<a id="overpost"></a>
###  Overposting

Using `TryUpdateModel` to update fields with posted values is a security best practice because it prevents overposting. For example, suppose the Student entity includes a `Secret` property that you don't want this web page to set.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string FirstMidName { get; set; }
    public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }
    public string Secret { get; set; }
}
```

Even if you don't have a `Secret` field on the web page, a hacker could set the secret value by overposting. A hacker could use a tool such as Fiddler, or write some JavaScript, to post a `Secret` form value.  The original code doesn't limit the fields that the model binder uses when it creates a Student instance. 

Whatever value the hacker specified for the `Secret` form field is updated in the DB. The following image shows the Fiddler tool adding the `Secret` field (with the value "OverPost") to the posted form values.

![Fiddler adding Secret field](../ef-mvc/crud/_static/fiddler.png)

The value "OverPost" is successfully added to the `Secret` property of the inserted row. The app designer never intended the `Secret` property to be set with the Create page.

<!-- TODO ASP team review required -->
<a name="vm"></a>
### View model

A view model typically contains a subset of the properties included in the model used by the application. The application model is often called the domain model. The domain model typically contains all the properties required by the corresponding entity in the DB. The view model contains only the properties needed for the UI layer (for example, the Create page). Consider the following `Student` view model:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Models/StudentVM.cs)]

View models provide an alternative way to prevent overposting. The view model contains only the properties to view (display) or update.

The following code uses the `StudentVM`  view model to create a new student:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/CreateVM.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostAsync)]
Using `StudentVM`  requires  [CreateVM.cshtml](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/data/ef-rp/intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/CreateVM.cshtml) be updated to use `StudentVM` rather than `Student`.

The [SetValues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.changetracking.propertyvalues.setvalues?view=efcore-2.0#Microsoft_EntityFrameworkCore_ChangeTracking_PropertyValues_SetValues_System_Object_) method sets the values of this object by reading values from another [PropertyValues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.changetracking.propertyvalues) object. The other object must be based on the same type as this object, or a type derived from the type for this object

## Update the Edit page

Update the Edit page code-behind file:

[!code-csharp[Main](intro/samples/cu/Pages/Students/Edit.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostAsync)]

The code changes are similar to the Create page with a few exceptions:

* `OnPostAsync` has an optional `id` parameter.
* The current student is fetched from the DB, rather than creating an empty student.

### Test the Edit and Create pages

Create and edit a few student entities.

## Entity States

The DB context keeps track of whether entities in memory are in sync with their corresponding rows in the DB.  The DB context sync information determines what happens when `SaveChanges` is called. For example,  when a new entity is passed to the `Add` method, that entity's state is set to `Added`.  When `SaveChanges` is called, the DB context issues a SQL INSERT command.

An entity may be in one of the following states:

* `Added`: The entity does not yet exist in the DB. The `SaveChanges` method issues an INSERT statement.

* `Unchanged`: Nothing needs to be done with this entity by the `SaveChanges` method.  An entity has this status when it is read from the DB.

* `Modified`: Some or all of the entity's property values have been modified. The `SaveChanges` method issues an UPDATE statement.

* `Deleted`: The entity has been marked for deletion. The `SaveChanges` method issues a DELETE statement.

* `Detached`: The entity isn't being tracked by the DB context.

In a desktop app, state changes are typically set automati cally. An entity is read, changes are made, and the  entity state to automatically be changed to `Modified`.  Calling `SaveChanges` generates a SQL UPDATE statement that updates only the changed properties.

In a web app, the `DbContext` that reads an entity and displays the data  is disposed after a page is rendered. When a pages `OnPostAsync` method is called,  a new web request is made and with a new instance of the `DbContext`.  Re-reading the entity in that new context simulates desktop processing.

<!-- I don't see how to use this with RP 
To avoid an extra read operation, use the entity object created by the model binder. 

But if you don't want to do the extra read operation, you have to use the entity object created by the model binder.  The simplest way to do this is to set the entity state to Modified as is done in the alternative HttpPost Edit code shown earlier. Then when you call `SaveChanges`, the Entity Framework updates all columns of the DB row, because the context has no way to know which properties you changed.

If you want to avoid the read-first approach, but you also want the SQL UPDATE statement to update only the fields that the user actually changed, the code is more complex. You have to save the original values in some way (such as by using hidden fields) so that they are available when the HttpPost `Edit` method is called. Then you can create a Student entity using the original values, call the `Attach` method with that original version of the entity, update the entity's values to the new values, and then call `SaveChanges`.
